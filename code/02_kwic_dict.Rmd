## Reading in the file

We use the Congressional Record date from the current (115th) Congress. There
are 4 datasets, with one for each year and each chamber. All are stored in the
`data` folder and comressed with gzip to save space.

```{r read-in, message=FALSE}
# House of Representatives
us_house_2017 <- readr::read_csv("../data/us-house-2017.csv.gz")
us_house_2018 <- readr::read_csv("../data/us-house-2018.csv.gz")
# Senate
us_senate_2017 <- readr::read_csv("../data/us-senate-2017.csv.gz")
us_senate_2018 <- readr::read_csv("../data/us-senate-2018.csv.gz")
```

While the Senate speeches come with many additional covariates, House data is
more limited in this regard. However, we can extract date from the API field
`granuleId`, using this, rather convoluted, regular expression.

```{r year}
pattern <- "20\\d\\d-(0[1-9]|1[012])-(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])"
us_house_2017 <- us_house_2017 %>%
    dplyr::mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(stringr::str_extract(granuleId, pattern)))
us_house_2018 <- us_house_2018 %>%
    dplyr::mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(stringr::str_extract(granuleId, pattern)))
```

## Create Corpus

First, we combine the datasets for two chambers (House of Representatives and Senate)
and two years (2017 and 2018) into one. Then, we can create a corpus by simply
passing the resultant data frame to `corpus()` function in `quanteda`. The variable
`text` is automatically recognised as the one containing the speeches and all the
other variables are treated as `docvars`.

```{r congress}
congress115 <- dplyr::select(us_house_2017, date, chamber, speaker, text) %>%
  dplyr::bind_rows(dplyr::select(us_house_2018, date, chamber, speaker, text)) %>%
  dplyr::bind_rows(dplyr::select(us_senate_2017, date, chamber, speaker, text)) %>%
  dplyr::bind_rows(dplyr::select(us_senate_2018, date, chamber, speaker, text))

head(congress115, 10)
```

```{r corpus}
corpus115 <- quanteda::corpus(congress115)
head(quanteda::docvars(corpus115), 10)
```

We can get some basic summary statistics by applying `summary()` on the corpus.

```{r summary}
summary(corpus115, 10)
```

## Document-frequency matrix and summary statistics

We are removing stopwords pre-specified in the `stopwords()` function. For more
details check the associated package `stopwords`.

```{r stopwords}
stopwords::stopwords("english")
```

To create a document-frequency matrix, we will use `dfm()` function. Many of the
parameters specified (such as `tolower` and `stem`) below are the defaults,
but it is often a good idea to be explicit about document pre-processing,
as it starts gradually getting more attention in the text analysis literature.
We are keeping the numbers, as they can refer to the bills being debated.

```{r dfm}
dfm115 <- quanteda::dfm(corpus115,
                        tolower = TRUE,
                        stem = FALSE,
                        remove = stopwords("english"),
                        remove_punct = TRUE,
                        remove_numbers = FALSE)
```

We can also group by chamber when creating a `dfm`.

```{r grouped_dfm}
grouped115 <- quanteda::dfm(corpus115,
                            tolower = TRUE,
                            stem = FALSE,
                            remove = stopwords("english"),
                            remove_punct = TRUE,
                            remove_numbers = FALSE,
                            group = "chamber")
```

To see the most frequently used terms we use the `topfeatures()` function.

```{r topfeatures}
quanteda::topfeatures(dfm115, 50)
```

We can also use `textstat_keyness()` function to compare how words are used
across groups of documents.
Here we are treating the Senate as a target group and House as the reference. 
What differences do you notice between the two chambers?

```{r keyness}
keyness <- quanteda::textstat_keyness(grouped115, target = "S")

head(keyness, 10)
tail(keyness, 10)
```

## Keywords-in-context

The idea to inspect the terms of interest within the smaller window of words
surrounding it was one of the first to emerge in automatic analysis of text.
Here, we will focus on a few issues that polarised US politics in the past
two years. In order to do that we will use `kwic()`
function and `textplot_xray()` for the graphical represenation of the results.
Note that we need to apply `kwic()` to a corpus, rather than a dfm.

Let us start with the **Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals**
(also known as DACA), the immigration policy that has been subject of much
debate under Trump's administration.

```{r daca}
daca <- quanteda::kwic(corpus115, "daca", window = 5, valuetype = "fixed")

head(daca, 50)
```

Interestingly, DACA is frequently mentioned in the context of other executive act,
**Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA)**,
that extended DACA to the parents of the 'Dreamers'. Let us now explore its context:

```{r dapa}
dapa <- quanteda::kwic(corpus115, "dapa", window = 5, valuetype = "fixed")

head(dapa, 50)
```

Looking at the number of rows of the resultant objects, it appears that DAPA
usually occurs in the context of the DACA discussion.

```{r nrow}
nrow(daca)
nrow(dapa)
```

Plotting the kwic object using the current corpus is problematic due to the
large number of documents. Let us make the original corpus more manageable by
merging together all speeches within the same month in House and Senate. We pass
`docid_field` parameter to get a more intuitive text labelling for the plot.

```{r aggregate}
aggregate115 <- congress115 %>%
  dplyr::mutate(year = as.character(lubridate::year(date)),
                month = as.character(lubridate::month(date)),
                year_month_chamber = paste(year, month, chamber, sep = "-")) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(year_month_chamber) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(text = paste(text, collapse = " "))

aggregate115 <- quanteda::corpus(aggregate115,
                                 docid_field = "year_month_chamber")
```

Now we can apply the `textplot_xray()` function to get some insight into the
distribution of the mentions of DACA over time and over chambers.

```{r xray}
quanteda::textplot_xray(kwic(aggregate115, "daca", window = 5, valuetype = "fixed"))
```

From the plot we can see that the bulk of the discussion took place in winter
2017/18 with somewhat higher number of mentions in the Senate.

## Dictionaries

Despite being perhaps the oldest analytical technique, dicitonaries are still
frequently used by many researchers. To define a simple dictionary we will
a `dictionary()` function.

```{r dictionary}
dict <- quanteda::dictionary(
  list(trade = c("trade", "tariff*", "trade agreement", "wto", "import", "export"),
       tax = c("fiscal", "tax*", "cuts", "treasury", "irs"),
       regulation = c("law", "regul*", "business", "shall", "must")))
```

To apply the dictionary we create another dfm and pass the dictionary as an argument.
Another way to apply it is to use `dfm_lookup()` function to the already existing
dfm.

```{r dict}
dict115 <- quanteda::dfm(corpus115, dictionary = dict)
head(dict115)

# Or, equivalently:
# `glob` refers to wildcards like "*" rather than regular expression
lookup115 <- quanteda::dfm_lookup(dfm115, dict, valuetype = "glob")
```

While helpful for certain kinds of analysis, a more useful approach might be to
apply dictionary to a grouped dfm.

```{r grouped_dict}
# Grouped by chamber
dict115 <- quanteda::dfm(grouped115, dictionary = dict)
head(dict115)

# It's also useful to see the proportions
quanteda::dfm_weight(dict115, scheme = "prop")
```

Let us now use some automatic heuristics to create a dictionary from a given seed.
We will use `trade` as our seed word and then proceed to explore the words most
often used together with it, but exclude those used in the corpus more generally.

```{r}
# Select all texts with "trade"
trade115 <- congress115 %>%
  dplyr::filter(grepl("trade", text))

trade115 <- quanteda::corpus(trade115)

# Extract most used terms in all the documents
top115 <- topfeatures(dfm115, 100)

# Extract most used terms in trade-related documents
toptrade115 <- topfeatures(dfm(trade115, remove = stopwords("en"), remove_numbers = TRUE, remove_punct = TRUE), 100)

# Get all the top words in toptrade that are not in the overall corpus
# As this is a named vector, we will apply names() function
autodict <- names(toptrade115)[!(names(toptrade115) %in% names(top115))]
autodict
```

## Challenge 2

**Easy mode** Explore the context of the words *gun* and *firearm* with the
`kwic()` function. Are there any issues with the default setting?
Treat them as `glob` to capture plural forms.

**Medium** Now plot the kwic objects on the aggregated corpus and explore when and
where these issues were discussed in the US Congress in the last two years.

**Advanced** To make the previous plot a bit nicer and easier to read,
order the aggregated texts by year, month, chamber. To do this, you would need
to modify the ordering of levels in the `aggregate115` dataset.

**Subject Expert** Create a dictionary related to gun violence and firearms
control and apply to Congress debates.
